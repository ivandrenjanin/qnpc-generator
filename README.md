# QNPC Generator

## User Guide:

Adds a button to `Roll for a new NPC` in `Rollable Tables`.
In order for Add-On to work, users must import `Quick NPC Rollable Tables` from `Compendium`.

## Other:

This Add on module just gathers names and traits and makes it easy for GMs to just roll on those and generate the NPC on the fly. It started as a macro that I used in my own game but decided to turn it into an addon if anyone else will find it useful as well. I am just starting to learn Foundry VTT API and what is all available there so this might be crude.

The names are picked from `XANATHAR'S GUIDE TO EVERYTHING` rollable tables. The rest of traits are picked from from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/452r6r/a_massive_and_growing_resource_of_random_tables/).

I will be looking into expanding this further and adding more functionalities. One of potential things that I wanted to add is, adding a button at the end of chat message to save the NPC entry into Jurnal.
